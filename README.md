# My MacOSX dotfiles (⌐■_■)

This is the safekeeping of my terminal environment ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

![Neofetch information][sysinfo]



## Programs I use:
* [Iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com "Iterm's homepage") - Terminal Replacement for Mac. Terminal app is still good, I'm just trying something new my dude.
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io "NeoVim's Homepage") - I still suck and will always suck at Vim, however Neovim will probs be the future anyway.
* [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki "Tmux's") - Terminal multiplexer. Still trying to get the hold of everything on this one. Not much going on except some vi keybindings.

## Programs I _Sometimes_ use:
* [VimR](http://vimr.org "VimR's homepage") - It's sexy AF, and a nice gui version for macOS. Probably will stop using it once i get good at Nvim & Tmux.


## Setup
Okay, so I have a setup directory

And it will eventually do a few things:
1) Git pull this repository
2) Symbolically link everything in the right place -> So far just .vimrc and .bash_profile
I think I'm gonna segment it into several files because I'm an idiot and don't want everything to break.
