# Welcome to My MacOSX dotfiles (yeet!)
There's not a lot here, I know. But like, there's beauty in simplicity.	

This is mainly just my safekeeping of my terminal environment. However additional settings will eventually "git"(yes I made a pun) into here.

## Programs I "use"
* [Iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com "Iterm's homepage") - Terminal Replacement for Mac. Terminal app is still good, I'm just trying to give Iterm a try since it's pretty.:
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io "NeoVim's Homepage") - I'm still a very novice user of Vim, however Neovim is definitely the future and I'm trying to make it my daily driver for code. 
* [Tmux]("https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki") - Terminal multiplexer. Still trying to get the hold of everything on this one. 
* [VimR](http://vimr.org "VimR's homepage") - It's sexy AF, and a nice gui version for macOS.
